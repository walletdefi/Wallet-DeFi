# ðŸ“Œ Web 3 Concepts

### `Web 3 Introduction`

Web 3.0 to which we are transitioning, will be a phase of greater decentralization, with more privacy for the user and transparency in the handling of his or her data.For the user, one of the main changes - which can already be seen in many solutions - is the possibility for anyone to become a more active part of the web.\
\
Not only in the production of content, as it is common to see today, but also in the creation of software and data infrastructures, thanks to user-friendly programming and design technologies.\
Thus, the new web will be more horizontal and less hierarchical, with greater autonomy and decision-making power for the user.The ways in which people interact with each other are also being transformed, with the growth of metaverse environments and virtual reality experiences.\
\
But the point that most relates to web 3.0 is data security, a very current problem, which should be attacked with blockchain, decentralizing the infrastructure that allows navigation and taking control of the data out of the hands of a few intermediaries.

### `Web3 Application`

Below, we explain some of the concepts that help to better understand the main characteristics of Web 3.0.

*   **Decentralization And Blockchain**\
    ``Traditionally, computers use the HTTP protocol to find information that is stored on servers, which are fixed locations.

    With Web 3.0, information will be stored in multiple locations, decentralizing control over the data.By decentralizing data storage networks, users will have more control over their own information.

    This new dynamic will be made possible by blockchain, a technology (best known for its role in enabling cryptocurrencies) for storing data in blocks, forming chains, that eliminates the need for a central intermediary.
*   #### Machine Learning

    It is a branch of artificial intelligence that corresponds to the ability of computer systems to learn from their own experiences.

    The most common application today is data processing software that, the more information it processes, the more efficient it becomes at finding patterns and organizing data.

    The trend is that with Internet 3.0, new machine learning solutions will emerge and current ones will be improved.

    The advance of artificial intelligence means a reality in which more and more processes are conducted without human interference.

    Machine learning, on the other hand, allows this development to accelerate further, because the machines themselves will be able to improve themselves.
*   **Metaverse and Virtual Reality Environments**\
    ****One of the buzzwords, the metaverse consists of a virtual space that provides an immersive experience.

    It usually involves a multidimensional environment, in which the user creates an avatar (a cyberbody, a representation of that individual in the metaverse) to interact with other people.

    The spaces of the metaverse can be explored in a two-dimensional experience, on computer screens and mobile devices, or three-dimensional, thanks to augmented reality devices.

    In Web 3.0, the metaverse appears both as an evolution of technology and a change in the behavior of users, who begin to interact in a parallel reality to that of the physical world.

### `Web 3 Wallet DeFi`

Wallet DeFi joined what is most current in the market, and we know that the web3 concept would be in our roots, and we will act in the 3 main functions mentioned above, our HTTP protocol has information stored in our platform, following the examples of large institutions. With this we have more control and also security, always enabling in our protocols security and profitability, because we are free of central intermediaries, which on the basis tax services. Our Machine Learning was a dev request, where we will organize data and standardize all software adapted to platforms, free of human maintenance, but always controlled and audited. Already the Wallet DeFi marketplace, will condition our users to interact with each other, interact with our NFT's and also participate in meetings in metaverse, where our chosen ones through governance, will have votes computed.
