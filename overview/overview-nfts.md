### `What are NFTs?`

NFTs are non-fungible digital assets mostly referred to as ERC721, ERC1155 on Ethereum, BEP721 and BEP1155 as NFTs on BSC that are either unique or limited in quantity. Think of them like you would a famous painting by Picasso or the video game Gamma Attack for the Atari 2600. NFTs are like vintage baseball cards but only in a digital form that is unique, non-fungible and secured using cryptography. Usually, crypto collectibles are represented as real-life objects such as pets or avatars. Some crypto collectibles are computer generated works of art. Each token has variations in specific attributes and there are limits to the number of tokens that can be generated.
