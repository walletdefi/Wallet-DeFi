# 🏛 Governance

### `Introduction Governance`

Governance tokens offer a different way to manage organizations. Common in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi), the governance token model offers a fairer, more decentralized and transparent method of governance. In most cases, one token is equivalent to one vote. These tokens are designed to unite communities and ensure that blockchain projects develop in a healthy way.

### `Application Governance`

Governance tokens are the primary method for performing decentralized governance in DAOs, DeFi, and decentralized application (DApp) projects. They are generally distributed to active users as a reward for their loyalty and their contributions to the community. In return, token holders vote on key proposals to ensure the healthy development of the projects. Usually, voting takes place via smart contracts. In this case, the results are implemented automatically.

### `DeFi Wallet Governance`

In our DeFi Wallet the governance is given by a DeFi protocol that allows all our investor holders to request or offer cryptocurrency loans. We will give permission to $WDF holders to vote on our proposals and help in the decision making. With this we will eliminate misaligned interests and build a very active, collaborative and close community!
