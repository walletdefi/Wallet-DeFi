WDF tokens represent voting shares in DeFi Yield Protocol governance. The introduction of WDF tokens enables shared community ownership of a vibrant, diverse, and dedicated governance system which will actively guide the protocol toward the future.

Through governance, WDF holders can vote to add more pools, burn tokens, or allocate WDF toward grants, strategic partnerships, governance initiatives, and other programs.

### `WDF Staking`&#x20;

Stake your WDF tokens and earn up to 25% APR with no impermanent loss. To start earning, all you need is to deposit WDF tokens into the Staking contract and earn rewards. The staking pools have the REINVEST function integrated, meaning that you can automatically add your daily rewards to the staking pool. Moreover, the WDF Referral is available. If you refer WDF to your friends, 5% of your friends’ rewards will automatically be sent to you whenever they stake WDF.

### `WDF Vault`&#x20;

The WDF Vault is an automated smart contract with Compound Protocol integration and support for ETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, and DAI markets.
