### `WDF Governance`&#x20;

WDF tokens represent voting shares in DeFi Yield Protocol governance. The introduction of WDF tokens enables shared community ownership of a vibrant, diverse, and dedicated governance system which will actively guide the protocol toward the future.

Through governance, WDF holders can vote to add more pools, burn tokens, or allocate WDF toward grants, strategic partnerships, governance initiatives, and other programs.

### `WDF Staking`&#x20;

Stake your WDF tokens and earn up to 25% APR with no impermanent loss. To start earning, all you need is to deposit WDF tokens into the Staking contract and earn rewards. The staking pools have the REINVEST function integrated, meaning that you can automatically add your daily rewards to the staking pool. Moreover, the WDF Referral is available. If you refer WDF to your friends, 5% of your friendsâ€™ rewards will automatically be sent to you whenever they stake WDF.

### `WDF Farming`&#x20;

All pool rewards are automatically converted from iWDF to WETH by the smart contract, decreasing the risk of iWDF price volatility.

### `WDF Vault`&#x20;

The WDF Vault is an automated smart contract with Compound Protocol integration and support for ETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, and DAI markets. The rewards from Compound Protocol are entirely distributed to the users; from the other strategies, a substantial proportion of the rewards (75%) is converted to ETH and distributed to the users, whereas the remainder (25%) is used to buy back our protocol token and burn it.

### `WDF Buyback`
